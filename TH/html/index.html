            <h2>MARKET ABUSE</h2>
        </div>
        
        <section class="mast-info body-text">        

        <p>
            We offer a powerful system for detecting suspected instances of market 
            abuse – our Market Abuse Surveillance Tool (<strong>MAST</strong>).

            MAST employs a unique combination of statistical analysis and behavioural 
            metrics. It is this methodology which allows MAST to so reliably highlight 
            true positives, reduce false positives and altogether provide a comprehensive 
            solution for the monitoring of market abuse.
        </p>

        <h2>Proven Resource</h2>

        <p>
            We have designed MAST to assist customers in meeting their regulatory 
            and supervisory requirements and obligations.

            To date, MAST has successfully identified hundreds of cases of market 
            abuse and insider dealing. Asset management firms use MAST on a daily 
            basis to monitor funds covering a total AUM of over eight trillion dollars. 
            Banks and active trading organisations also use the tool daily to check 
            for regulatory breaches in hundreds of millions of orders and trades.

            At the core of MAST’s success is its ability to accurately highlight 
            trader outperformance. In the course of its analysis, MAST dynamically 
            estimates the average behaviour of a fair trader in the given context. 
            It is then able to highlight behaviours that are far beyond the market’s 
            expected average, effectively cutting out false positives in the process.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Data</h2>
        <p>
            MAST ingests a variety of trade reports ranging from daily aggregated 
            trade data to fill-by-fill intra-day reports. MAST identifies suspicious 
            transactions even when the data does not include offsetting non-reported 
            legs.
